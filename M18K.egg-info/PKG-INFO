# M18K: Mushroom Detection Dataset

Welcome to the Mushroom Detection Dataset repository. This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in automating agricultural processes, specifically related to mushroom harvesting, growth monitoring, and quality control. It provides a dedicated dataset for button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) detection, comprising over 18,000 mushroom instances in 423 RGB-D image pairs.

## Overview

The dataset was collected using an Intel RealSense D405 camera, capturing realistic growth environment scenarios with comprehensive annotations. It serves as a benchmark for detection and instance segmentation algorithms in smart mushroom agriculture.

## Dataset Details

- **Mushroom Instances**: Over 18,000
- **Image Pairs**: 423 RGB-D image pairs
- **Camera Used**: Intel RealSense D405
- **Annotations**: Comprehensive annotations for detection and instance segmentation
